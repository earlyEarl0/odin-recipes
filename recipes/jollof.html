<ol>
    <li> Parboil beans-In a large pot over medium heat add beans and water. Bring to a boil then reduce heat and let simmer, covered, 45 minutes or until beans are al-dente. drain and set aside </li>
    <li> In another pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and minced garlic, and sauté until translucent. </li>
    <li> Stir in the tomato paste and cook for a few minutes to deepen the flavor. Then, add the tomato and red bell pepper puree, stirring well to combine. Let it fry for 15-30 minutes or until most of the water reduces.Season with paprika, thyme, curry powder, bay leaves, and salt. Mix the spices into the sauce and let it cook for about 5 minutes, allowing the flavors to blend together. </li>
    <li> Add the washed parboiled rice to the pot and stir it gently to coat it evenly with the sauce. Be careful not to break the rice grains. </li>
    <li> Pour in enough water to cover the rice, typically about 4 cups, but adjust as needed depending on the type of rice you’re using. Stir well, then cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and reduce the heat to low. Allow the rice to steam on low heat for about 30-40 minutes or until it’s cooked through and the liquid has been absorbed.</li>
