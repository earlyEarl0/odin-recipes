    <h2> DESCRIPTION </h2>
    <p> Is it just me but I feel like ogbono soup has a bad rep in the streets. If you have never tasted ogbono before and you see its slimy goodness for the first time you might think ” Eww” but I assure you that you are wrong. You see this soup is not any regular smegular kind of soup. if it is made correctly, there is so much to love about it    </p>
